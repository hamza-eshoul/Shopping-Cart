[![fr](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-fr-blue)](README.fr.md)

This is the repository for the Shopping Cart Project built for the [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-react-new-shopping-cart).

The goal of the project was to build a mock shopping cart to practice React JS concepts accumulated throught the curriculum.

The shopping items that I chose for this project are computers.
